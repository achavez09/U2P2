    <p>Opioids are a type of drug originating from the poppy plant. Opioids can be used for pain relief and are
      sometimes given by doctors. Opioids include drugs like heroin, fentanyl and morphine. Opioids may be taken orally,
      snorted, smoked or injected with a syringe (needle). Using opioids frequently can eventually lead to an addiction.
      Certain opioids, like fentanyl, are synthetic. This means that they are created in labs.</p>

      class="center" img alt= "a green chart that describes the short-term and long-term effects of opioid abuse.">
    <p>People who use opiods often feel symptoms of pain relief and euphoria. If you use opioids, you may also have
      contracted pupils, loose muscles, slurred speech, nausea, constipaion, or slow breathing. In the case of an
      overdose, you might stop breathing entirely. The usage of opioids clouds a person's judgement and makes it
      difficult for them to think clearly. It is important to know that a person's actions while they are using
      substances will most likely not reflect on what they would've done had they not been using, but that does not
      excuse the damage they may have caused.</p>

    <p>People who do opioids (or any type of drug) are heavily judged. Theyâ€™re seen as weak for not being able to stop
      their addiction. Drug users are seen as crazy or unsafe. People fail to consider WHY the user is turning to
      substance use. Many drug users feel pressured to do so by their peers, while some users turn to drugs as a means
      to relieve stress. Students who engage in substance use are often punished, being expelled or suspended. This
      makes things potentially worse for the student.</p>

    <p>As mentioned in the previous section, people can experience opioid overdose. This happens when a person takes
      more opioids than their body can handle. Someone may be experiencing an opioid overdose if:</p>
    <ul>
      <p>- They have slow, shallow and erratic breathing </p>
      <p>- Pinpoint pupils </p>
      <p>- Make snoring or gurgling sounds</p>
      <p>- Are unconscious/unresponsive to stimuli</p>
      <p>- Limp</p>
      <p>- Have a slow pulse or no pulse at all</p>
      <p>- They have pale, clammy skin</p>
    </ul>
    <p> It can be scary to witness a person have an opioid overdose, but remember that if you're there on the scene,
      it's up to you to help! Use your handy dandy naloxone. Naloxone is a medicine that reverses opioid overdose. It
      lasts for around 90 minutes. Naloxone is exclusively for opioids, but it will do no harm to the person if you use
      it for other situations (ex. alcohol poisoning). Naloxone can be found in many pharmacies, and most will give it
      to you free of charge. To use naloxone, insert the top part into one of the person's nostrils. Afterwards, press
      the red part. This should pump naloxone into the person's body.</p>

    <p>If you don't have naloxone on you, it's best to call 911 immediately. In New York City, there is the Good
      Samaritan Law. This law protects the caller and the person experiencing opioid overdose from getting into conflict
      with the police. It encourages people to help save lives.</p>

    <p>If you are struggling with addiction, call the SAMHSA Helpline at: 1-800-662-HELP.</p>
